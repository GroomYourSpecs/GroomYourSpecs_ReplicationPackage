I think this is true in most approaches: as we learn more, we refine our vision. "
3,4/10/25 14:53:14,4/10/25 15:34:14,anonymous,,,Interviewee 4,Basic knowledge,"Robotic mission specification approaches interleave user intents and desires, available resources (robots and knowledge from the environment), robot capabilities, and robotic behavior to satisfy the intent. Top-down approaches start from intents and end in behavior implementation, while bottom-up start from behavior which composes intents. I have experience with goal-driven approaches which leverage modeling high-level models (i.e., goal models) to represent the users intents, the goal models go through a series of transformations aggregating information about available resources, robot skills and skill implementations to enact an intent-driven behavior.",Very suitable,Moderately encouraged,Extremely encouraged,"I believe MutRoSe tackles important challenges in top-down approaches, for instance empowering users with no or little knowledge in how is a robot is built with an easier to read and write formalism. MutRoSe integrates goal (and intent) modeling, mission planning (in PDDL-based structure), and resource management in a single tool. While before MutRoSe, most of the mission planning specification would either go directly into PDDL specifications which do not precisely allows for defining objectives and composing objectives, it is targeted to sequencing of task execution."

By leveraging task decomposition with HTNs, it supports the creation of flexible and adaptable mission models."

7,4/17/25 7:48:24,4/17/25 8:02:45,anonymous,,,Interviewee 10,Advanced knowledge,"HTNs and iHTNs, goal models, and hierarchical state machines, plus hybrid approaches that leverage a combination of different models for the specification of the mission at a high abstraction level (goal or task-level, using, for instance, HTNs) and a low abstraction level (action and robot skill level, using, for instance, behavior trees or state machines), such as in MissionControl.",Suitable,Very encouraged,Extremely encouraged,"MutRoSe provides a simple-to-specify but effective way to decompose missions from high-level goals towards actions, and demonstrates the validity and power of top-down approaches for specifying robotic missions."
8,4/18/25 8:14:06,4/18/25 10:39:43,anonymous,,,Interviewee 7,Advanced knowledge,HTN,Very suitable,Very encouraged,Extremely encouraged,"After seeing MutRoSe, I became even more convinced that the use of top-down and hierarchically structured approaches is highly suitable for specifying missions for robots.

In particular, the ability to specify from higher-level goal tasks, through intermediate (compound) tasks (which can themselves be composed of simpler tasks), down to primitive actions is truly powerful and flexible, yet also well-suited for both practitioners�such as experienced developers and modelers (who are interested in all levels down to the leaves, in order to reach a higher level of detail)�and for modelers or other users with limited or no robotics experience (who can start from the higher levels, understand the mission in its entirety in an incremental way, and then gradually refine it down to the lowest-level primitive actions that will actually be executed by the robots).

After seeing MutRoSe, I also gained a deeper appreciation for how the ability to automate the mission decomposition process and the allocation of tasks to robots, along with the management of dependencies, is of fundamental importance and provides significant support for non-expert modelers.

Last but not least, the ability to intuitively consider environmental variability at a high level further enhances the flexibility and expressiveness of the specification language, while also simplifying its use."

Several parts need to be specified when designing and specifying a robotic system, like the environment, mission, robot, tasks, and so on. In the top-down approach, the mission is first defined, then tasks, the robot, and the plan are designed to achieve the mission.",Very suitable,Slightly encouraged ,Moderately encouraged,"MutRoSe unifies different specification tools to model a robotic mission in a cohesive framework. Before MutRoSe, the developer(s) needed to handle and track the various tools, ensuring the mission was correctly defined."
